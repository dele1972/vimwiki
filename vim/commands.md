## Commenting out a block of code with Vim

https://eli.thegreenplace.net/2010/08/25/commenting-out-a-block-of-code-with-vim

1. Move to the first column in the first line you want to comment-out.
2. Press Ctrl-V to start block-mode selection.
3. Move down to select the first column of a block of lines.
4. Press I and then the desired comment starter (i.e. #)
5. Press ESC and the insertion will be applied to the whole block.

To uncomment with this techniques follow the directions but instead of I use x to delete the first char.
